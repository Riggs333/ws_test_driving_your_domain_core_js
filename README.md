# Workshop: Test Driving 
Sources to get you started with NodeJS, cucumber and typescript.
Just run `yarn install` to set everything up.

`yarn test` should  run both acceptance and unit tests. 

The **acceptance tests** themselves have already been written for you - you just need to provide some "glue" to run the application. You should do that in [ShoppingCartSteps](acceptance/features/step_definitions/shopping_cart_steps.ts)
